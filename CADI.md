# Crypto Asset Discovery Tools (CADI) Index

A crucial first step in transitioning to quantum-safe cryptography is understanding your cryptographic landscape. This requires discovering and inventorying the cryptographic assets within your IT environment.

Various Crypto Asset Discovery (CADI) tools are emerging from different vendors, each with unique approaches and varying levels of maturity. Keeping track of this evolving market can be challenging.

The **CADI Index** aggregates publicly available information about these tools to support cybersecurity professionals in their research and decision-making. All data included here comes from public sources, such as [NIST SP 1800-38B](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/pqc-migration-nist-sp-1800-38b-preliminary-draft.pdf) and official vendor websites.

## Index Structure

- Tools are listed alphabetically by *vendor name*.
- *Yes/No* fields indicate whether a tool is confirmed to support a specific functionality.
- A blank field means the functionality is either unknown or unconfirmed.
